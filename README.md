## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Fullstack Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing and building scalable web applications across enterprise and e-commerce environments.

I specialize in:

- Modern Frontend Architecture (React, TypeScript, Next.js, Vue)
- Backend Services with Java & Spring Boot
- REST API Design & Microservices
- Performance Optimization
- Clean Code & Type Safety
- Magento 2 Integrations

I don’t just write code — I design systems.

Currently working at the **National Electoral Institute (INE)** in Mexico, contributing to national-scale applications and backend microservices architecture.
